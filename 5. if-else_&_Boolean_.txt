------if-else & Boolean -----

1. what are booleans.
   - booleans are data type in JS it can either be "true" or be "false".
   - like "0" or "1".

   - typeof --> shows the data type 

2. Comparison Operators.
   - Equality operator -->  '==' (check equality and explicitly type cast).
                           '===' (check value and type equality ).

   - Inequality operator -->  != (chck val not equal), !== (chek val and type Inequality).
   - Relational operator -->  >, <, >=, <= .  
   
   - the priority of comparision operator is less than arithmetic operators.
      which mean first consider the arithematic calculations then comparision occurs.      
  
3. if-else.
   -> Done

4. Logical Operator.
   -> &&, || 

5. JS Variable Scope.
   - 1. Global Scope : Accesible everywhere.
   - 2. Local Scope : Limited Access mean within perticular block.
     - Block scope --> let, const.
     - function scope --> var --> does't follow scope (access inside as well as outside 
                                 the block).


6. Truthy and falsy Values.

   -> Falsy Values : 0, null, undefined, false, NaN, ""(empty string).
   -> Truthy Values : All values not listed as falsy.
   -> Used in conditional statement like if.
   -> Non-boolean values are auto-converted in logical operations.
   -> Be explicit in comparisons to avoid unexpected behaviour. 


7. If alternates.

   -> 1. Ternary Operator : Condition ? trueValue : falseValue. (in one line ).

   -> 2. Guard Operator : value(if true prinit) || defaultValue (if not then print defaultValue).
        - Use when a fallback value is needed.

   -> 3. Default Operator : value(if null or undefined) ?? fallbackValue (print this ).
        - Use when u want to consider only null and undefined as falsy. 

   -> 4. Simplifies condional logic.

   -> 5. Use wisely to maintain readability.
